## Usage Guide

### 1. Creator Resources
- Access to Form Creator
- Access to Workflow Creator
- Access quick actions

### 2. Form Creation Process

#### Step 1: Access Form Creator
1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Click on "Form Creator" tab
3. Choose from three options:
   - **Create New Form**: Start from scratch
   - **Use Template**: Start with pre-built templates
   - **Import Form**: Import from external sources

#### Step 2: Create Form Structure
1. **From Scratch**:
   - Click "Create Form" button
   - Enter form name and description
   - Click "Create Form" to start building

2. **From Template**:
   - Click "Use Template" button
   - Select from available templates (Legal Intake, Client Information, etc.)
   - Click "Use This Template" to start with pre-built structure

#### Step 3: Build Your Form
1. **Drag and Drop Interface**:
   - Drag field types from the left panel to the canvas
   - Configure field properties (label, validation, required status)
   - Organize fields into sections

2. **Field Configuration**:
   - Set field labels and descriptions
   - Configure validation rules
   - Set required/optional status
   - Add field-specific options (dropdown choices, file types, etc.)

#### Step 4: Preview and Test
1. **Preview Form**: Click the eye icon to see how the form looks
2. **Test Form**: Click "Test" button to interact with the form with validation
3. **Save Form**: Click "Save Form" to store your creation

#### Step 5: Manage Forms
- **Edit**: Modify existing forms
- **Duplicate**: Create copies of forms
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted forms
- **Export**: Share forms with others


### 3. Workflows

#### Step 1: Access the Workflow Designer
1. Navigate to the "Workflows" section from the main dashboard.
2. Click the "Create Workflow" button to start a new workflow.

#### Step 2: Name and Describe the Workflow
1. Enter a unique name for your workflow in the "Workflow Name" field.
2. (Optional) Add a description to clarify the workflowâ€™s purpose.

#### Step 3: Add Forms to the Workflow
1. Click "Add Form" or drag forms from the available list into the workflow canvas.
2. Select the forms you want to include as steps in your workflow.
3. Repeat to add multiple forms as needed.

#### Step 4: Connect Forms in Sequence
1. Arrange the forms in the desired order on the canvas.
2. Draw connections between forms to define the flow (e.g., drag from the end of one form to the start of the next).
3. Ensure there is a clear start and end to the workflow.

#### Step 5: Review and Save the Workflow
1. Double-check the workflow structure and connections.
2. Click the "Save Workflow" button to store your workflow.

#### Step 6: View and Manage Workflows
1. After saving, your workflow will appear in the "All Workflows" list.
2. From here, you can view, edit, duplicate, or delete workflows as needed.

### 4. Execute Workflows

1. Navigate to the **"Execute Workflows"** section from the main dashboard.
2. In the **"Available Workflows"** list, locate the workflow you want to run.
3. Click the **"Execute Workflow"** button for your chosen workflow.
4. In the **"Create New Request"** modal:
   - Enter a title for your request.
   - Select the workflow you want to execute (if not already selected).
   - Click **"Create Request"**.
5. The workflow execution will begin. For each step:
   - Complete the form fields as required.
   - Click **"Next"** or **"Submit"** to proceed to the next step.
   - Repeat until all steps are completed.
6. Track your progress using the visual stepper at the top of the page.
7. After completing all steps, review the summary and confirm completion.
8. Your workflow execution will be marked as **completed**. You can view details or re-execute by clicking the appropriate button in the request list.

## Key Components

### Form Builder
- **FieldPalette**: Draggable field types
- **FormSections**: Draggable form section
- **FormCanvas**: Drop zone for form building
- **FormFieldRenderer**: Individual field configuration

### Workflow Designer
- **WorkflowDesigner**: Main workflow canvas
- **FormNode**: Form nodes in workflow
- **StartNode/EndNode**: Workflow start/end nodes

### Workflow Execution
- **WorkflowExecution**: Step-by-step workflow execution

## State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management with three main stores:

- **FormStore**: Manages forms and form fields
- **WorkflowStore**: Manages workflows and workflow nodes
- **RequestStore**: Manages requests and execution state

## Data Models

### Form
```typescript
interface Form {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  fields: FormField[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Workflow
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  nodes: WorkflowNode[];
  connections: Array<{from: string; to: string}>;
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'completed';
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Request
```typescript
interface Request {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  workflowId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  currentStep: number;
  formData: Record<string, any>;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Development

### Adding New Field Types
1. Add the field type to the `FormField` interface in `types/index.ts`
2. Add the field to `FIELD_TYPES` in `components/form-builder/FieldPalette.tsx`
3. Implement field rendering logic in `FormFieldRenderer`

### Adding New Workflow Node Types
1. Create a new node component in `components/workflow-designer/`
2. Add the node type to the `nodeTypes` object in `WorkflowDesigner.tsx`
3. Implement node-specific logic

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom styles can be added to `app/globals.css`.

## Deployment

### Build for Production
